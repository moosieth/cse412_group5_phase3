# CSE 412 Spring 2023, Group 5 Project Phase III

A repository to hold the code for Group 5's CSE 412 Project

## What does this project do?

In short, this project contains:

1. A Docker image for a MySQL Database
2. a Flask App to act as an API to retrieve data from / send data to that
   Database
3. A React JS Front-End application (eventually)

We're still developing, though! Come back later to see what it looks like once
its finished!
